    <h2>I go by Cote</h2>
    <p>I'm so excited to start this semester. I'm trom Santiago in Chile but I moved here on September 2020. I came here to study english and see the option to start a carrer after that. In between all of that I met who is my husband now. We just got married on October of the last year.</p>
    <p>I'm so excite to start this. I love learning new things! Having in mind what I want for my future with my husband and future family, I feel this is the right decision. I'm also a photographer right now. I do portraits, couples and engagements sessions.</p>
    <p>About my journey int the Church, I got married on 2013, I think I was 11-12 years old when I got baptize, I got sealed to my family on 2015 and I served a mission in Chile, Vina del Mar (2017-2019). It was amazing and I leamed so much!</p>
    <p>Can't wait to meet all of you</p>
