        HEY THERE,
        Welcome!
        I'm very glad you stopped by! My name is María José but go by Cote.
        Photography has been something I have really enjoyed since before I can remember. When I was... [bottom to open and see more in "about page"]

        [It is very important as a photographer to have a website. Today it is pretty common to just use social media as a portfolio or site to have clients, which is valid, specially instagram makes it so easy but it is not a safe platform, it is not a platform that you have control of and that you can manage and even customize. You can give your clients an experience through your website, show more of your style of you as a person and more of your background as a photographer. At the moment to hire a photographer and especially when you are actually in the session you have to connect with the photographer to be able to be yourself and show that through the images. 
        Since it is a photography website it is going to be mostly images rather than text but there is a contact form that I think would be a good idea to see what the client is looking for.]

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        “I'm very glad you stopped by! I’m María José but I go by Cote and I'm a photographer based in Salt Lake City Utah. 
        Photography has been something I have really enjoyed since before I can remember. When I was in my country, Chile, I took a photography course in 2017 and after that course I began studying however I could. I also enjoy landscape and light painting photography so much but just as a hobby.
        My goal is to create with you, serve you and help you. Go an extra mile to be able to have unique, colorful, fun and representative creative portraits,  especially women to feel confident, empowered and to be able to express themselves in front of the camera and with me. If you are looking for that, you are in the right place.
        I also love photographing couples and families. I enjoy getting to know different love stories and capture them to treasure forever. You literally don't need any excuse to capture a time of your life with the ones you love. So let's get in touch and let's capture your story!”

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        I'm going to divide my portfolio here by all the services that I offer that are portfolio, couple and engagement and family sessions.
        Kind Words:
        “It was a really fun session. I always felt intimidated with others photographing me but with Maria it was different. She is an excellent professional and makes everything dynamic. She not only takes photos but participates in every moment and pays attention to every detail” - Suzana Farias
        “Cote put our family at ease and made taking family pictures enjoyable! The picture turned out incredible and she was so patient working with our little daughter. I’ll cherish these pictures forever!” - Lauren & Hunter
        "You were so sweet and I loved learning about you and your life! The photos turned out SO good and I’m super excited to post them! I appreciated you giving ideas for poses, but letting us choose as well.” Millie & Matthew
